## Today's Log: Debugging and First Success

Today was about bringing the foundation to life, which involved a systematic debugging process. Every error we fixed made the application more robust.

    User Authentication Code

        Wrote the code for our first real feature: User Registration and Login.

        This included creating the security.py utility for password hashing, schemas/user.py for data validation, and the service functions and API endpoints for creating a user and logging in.

    Debugging the Server and Database
    We systematically resolved a series of common setup errors:

        ModuleNotFoundError: Fixed by running the server with python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload, which helps Python find our app modules correctly.

        ImportError: Solved by creating empty __init__.py files in the api, db, and core directories, which officially turns them into Python packages.

        email-validator not installed: Fixed by running pip install "pydantic[email]" to add the extra dependency needed for email validation.

        ArgumentError: ...got None: This was a tricky one. We debugged it by checking the .env file's location, name, and content. This phase also included installing PostgreSQL and setting the database password.

        UndefinedTable: relation "users" does not exist: The final major bug. We fixed this by running the complete two-step Alembic process: alembic revision --autogenerate to create the migration script, and alembic upgrade head to apply it and create the tables in the database.

    Milestone Achieved: Successful User Creation ✅

        The session culminated in a successful 201 Created response from the POST /api/v1/users/ endpoint.

        This confirms that the entire backend is now fully functional—the API receives requests, communicates with the database, and correctly stores data.

You've successfully built and debugged a complete backend authentication system. The next step is to test the login endpoint and then begin work on the core features of the app.
