# Project Log: AI Pipeline Implementation
**Date:** August 14, 2025

### ## Objective
Today's goal was to transition from a basic backend to a fully functional, intelligent analysis system. We focused on implementing the "smart" AI and GIS pipeline that processes billboard reports submitted by users.

---
### ## Key Accomplishments

1.  **Enabled Image Uploads**
    * Upgraded the `POST /api/v1/reports/` endpoint to accept `multipart/form-data`, allowing users to submit a JSON payload (latitude/longitude) and an image file in a single request.
    * Modified the `report_service` to save uploaded images to a local directory (`uploaded_images/`) with a unique filename corresponding to the report ID.

2.  **Implemented Background Task Processing**
    * Integrated FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` into the reports endpoint.
    * This ensures that the time-consuming AI analysis runs in the background *after* a success response is sent to the user, creating a fast and non-blocking user experience.
    * Created a dedicated `analysis_service.py` to house the pipeline logic, starting with placeholder functions.

3.  **Custom Billboard Detection Model (YOLOv8)**
    * Sourced a suitable public dataset of billboard images from Roboflow Universe.
    * Created and executed a complete Google Colab notebook to **fine-tune** a pre-trained YOLOv8 model, teaching it to specifically recognize billboards.
    * Successfully integrated the resulting custom model (`best.pt`) into our `analysis_service`, replacing the placeholder "tv" detection with real, targeted billboard detection.

4.  **Advanced Text Violation Analysis (OCR + BERT)**
    * Integrated the **Google Cloud Vision API** for high-accuracy Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from billboard images.
    * Inspired by academic research, we upgraded our text analysis from a simple keyword search to a sophisticated NLP model. We used a pre-trained **BERT-based text classifier** (`unitary/toxic-bert`) from the Hugging Face `transformers` library to analyze the OCR text for contextual violations.

### ## Key Challenges & Resolutions

* **Google Cloud Credentials:** We resolved a recurring `Your default credentials were not found` error by correctly setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in the terminal session before running the server.
* **Missing Python Packages:** Solved `ModuleNotFoundError` issues by adding necessary libraries (`ultralytics`, `google-cloud-vision`, `transformers`) to the `requirements.txt` file and running `pip install`.
* **Model Training Path:** Corrected a `FileNotFoundError` in the Colab notebook by adjusting the path to the dataset's `data.yaml` file.

### ## Current Status
The backend is now feature-complete in its core AI analysis. The full end-to-end flow is working:
1.  A user can register and log in.
2.  An authenticated user can submit a report with location data and an image.
3.  A background task is triggered that uses a custom-trained AI model to **detect billboards** in the image and a second AI model to **read and analyze the text** for violations.

The final remaining piece of the pipeline is the GIS check.
